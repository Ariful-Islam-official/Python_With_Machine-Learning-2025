# ðŸ“˜ Class 14 â€“ Machine Learning Projects

In **Class 14**, we implemented **two hands-on projects** to apply the machine learning concepts learned so far. These projects cover end-to-end workflows including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project 1: [Diabetes Prediction](../Day14/Project_1_Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb)

* **Objective**: Build a machine learning model to predict whether a patient is diabetic based on health-related features.
* **Techniques Used**:

  * Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  * Train-Test Split
  * Standardization
  * Logistic Regression Classification
* **Files**:

  * ðŸ“„ [Project\_1\_Diabetes\_Prediction.ipynb](../Day14/Project_1_Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb) â†’ Jupyter Notebook with complete code & explanation
  * ðŸ“Š [diabetes.csv](../Dataset/diabetes.csv) / [diabetes.xlsx](../Dataset/diabetes.xlsx) â†’ Dataset used for model training

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project 2: [Fake News Prediction](../Day14/Project_2_Fake_News_Prediction.ipynb)

* **Objective**: Create a machine learning model to detect whether a given news article is **real or fake**.
* **Techniques Used**:

  * Text Preprocessing (stopwords removal, stemming)
  * Feature Extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
  * Train-Test Split
  * Logistic Regression Classifier
* **Files**:

  * ðŸ“„ [Project\_2\_Fake\_News\_Prediction.ipynb](../Day14/Project_2_Fake_News_Prediction.ipynb) â†’ Jupyter Notebook with full pipeline
  * ðŸ“Š [fake\_news.csv](../Dataset/fake_news.csv) â†’ Dataset used for training & testing

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Access

All datasets required for these projects are:

* Included in the [`dataset/`](../Dataset/) folder of this repository
* Also available in the **Google Drive shared folder link** (for backup access)

---

ðŸ‘‰ These projects will help you understand how to **apply machine learning algorithms in real-world scenarios**, from medical data classification to natural language processing tasks.

âš¡ Question: Do you want me to make these links **relative (like above)** or **absolute GitHub links (full URL with your repo name)** so they work directly from anywhere (not just inside GitHubâ€™s repo view)?
